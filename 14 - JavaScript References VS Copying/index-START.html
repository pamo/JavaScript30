    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
		const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
		team[1] = 'Pam';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
		console.log('Team', team);

    // now here is the problem!
		console.log('Players', players);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
		const team2 = players.splice();
    // one day
		team2[0] = 'puppy';
		console.log('Team 2', team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
		const team3 = [].concat(players);
		team3[0] = 'Wario';
		console.log('Team 3', team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
		const squad = [...players];
		squad[0] = 'Mario';
		console.log('Squad', squad);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
		const person = {
			name: 'bob',
			age: 12,
			city: 'New York',
			social: {
				twitter: '@bob'
			}
		}

    // with Objects
		console.clear();
		const copy = person;

    // and think we make a copy:
		copy.age = 27;
		console.log('Bob', person);
		console.log('copy', copy);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
		const pam = Object.assign({},  person, {
			name: 'Pam',
			age: 27
		});
		console.log('Bob', person);
		console.log('Pam', pam);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
		pam.social.facebook = 'pamocampo';

		console.log('Bob', person);
		console.log('Pam', pam);
